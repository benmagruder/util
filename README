The classes in the util/ directory tree provide general utilities for 
scientific programming in C++. This directory was originally developed 
as part of the simpatico molecular simulation package. It is maintained
as a separate git repository to allow it to be used in other packages, 
and is used as a submodule of the simpatico git repository.

Subdirectories:
---------------

misc           Exception, Log, FileMaster and other utilities
format         formatted output of primitive types in ostreams
memory         class for managing dynamically allocated memory
containers     container template classes and associated iterators
mpi            utilities for MPI programming
param          parameter file input and output
math           mathematical constants and operations
space          Cartesian vectors, tensors, and grids
boundary       periodic boundary conditions
crystal        crystallographic symmetry
ensembles      statistical mechanical ensembles
archives       serialization (similar to Boost serialization)
random         random number generator
accumulators   statistical accumulator classes

Makefile targets:
-----------------

The makefile in src/util may be used to compile the classes in src/util.
The most important targets are:

make all       make all *.o files in src/util
make clean     remove all *.o files in src/util
