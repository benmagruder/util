   /**
   * An array-valued parameter in a parameter file.
   *
   * ArrayParam is a base class for objects that read and write the 
   * value of an array containing a list of parameters of the same type. 
   * The parameter file format for a parameter contains a string label 
   * followed by values of the elements of the array. 
   *
   * Arrays can be read and written in either of two formats:
   * 
   *   - Bracketed format begins with a label immediately followed by an
   *     opening left bracket "[" on a line by itself, followed by several 
   *     data lines, and ends with a closing bracket ("]") on a line by
   *     itself.
   *
   *   - Bracket-free format begins with a label on the same line as the 
   *     first line of data, with no opening or closing delimit
   *
   * The choice of whether to use bracketed or bracket-free format 
   * is determined by the value of the global policy returned by the 
   * function Util::BracketPolicy::get() :
   *
   *   - If the policy is BracketPolicy::Required, the bracketed format
   *     must be used for both reading and writing.
   *
   *   - If the policy is BracketPolicy::Forbidden, the bracket-free 
   *     format must be used for both reading and writing.
   *
   *   - If the policy is BracketPolicy::Optional, then either format
   *     can be read, but the bracketed format is used for writing.
   *
   * If the bracket policy is optional, the code determines if brackets
   * are being used on input by looking for an opening bracket at the
   * end of the label. A closing bracket is then required if an opening
   * bracket is found, and forbidden if no opening bracket is found.
